## Licensing and Open Source Compliance

PocketBase is licensed under the **MIT License**, a permissive open-source license that allows users to freely use, modify, and redistribute the software with minimal restrictions [1][2]. The license grants broad permissions, including the right to incorporate PocketBase into proprietary applications without requiring public disclosure of source code [3]. However, redistribution must include the original copyright notice and license text [4].

### Key Compliance Requirements
- **Attribution**: While the MIT License mandates preserving the copyright notice and license text, explicit attribution in end-user applications (e.g., "about" sections) is not strictly required but is considered a best practice [5][6].
- **Redistribution**: Users may distribute modified or unmodified versions of PocketBase, provided the original license and copyright notice remain intact [4]. This applies to both source code and binary distributions [7].
- **Legal Considerations**: The MIT License includes a **disclaimer of liability**, meaning PocketBase is provided "as-is" without warranties. Users assume all risks associated with its use, including in production environments [8].

The license aligns with open-source standards by ensuring compatibility with other permissive licenses (e.g., Apache 2.0, BSD) while avoiding the "copyleft" restrictions of licenses like GPL [9]. For commercial use, no additional permissions or royalties are required [10].

## Security and Vulnerability Management

PocketBase enforces a structured approach to security, prioritizing vulnerability reporting, patch management, and incident response. **Vulnerability reporting** is streamlined via a dedicated email channel (`support@pocketbase.io`), ensuring private disclosure of security issues [1][2][3][4]. This aligns with best practices for responsible disclosure, as outlined by OWASP guidelines [19].

**Patch management** is proactive, with updates addressing vulnerabilities like CVE-2024-45338 in dependencies (e.g., `golang.org/x/net`) [7][16]. Releases include backported fixes for critical issues, ensuring long-term support for older versions (e.g., v0.22.x until Q1 2025) [7]. This reflects compliance with ISO 27001’s Clause 12.6.1, emphasizing timely remediation and documentation [20].

**Incident response** leverages GitHub’s Security Advisories to track and publish known vulnerabilities, fostering transparency [2]. Community discussions highlight mitigations for risks like brute-force attacks, though native protections (e.g., rate limiting) are not explicitly documented [8]. For production use, PocketBase recommends additional safeguards, such as Content Security Policy (CSP) configurations and input validation to prevent XSS/CSRF [5][10].

## Data Protection and Privacy Compliance

PocketBase provides several features to help users align with data protection regulations like **GDPR** and **CCPA**, though it requires manual configuration for full compliance.

### **Encryption and Data Security**
PocketBase does not natively support end-to-end database encryption. However, developers can encrypt sensitive fields (e.g., API keys) using **AES-256** via custom hooks or by leveraging PocketBase’s upcoming *"secret" field type* [2]. For production deployments, administrators should enable **settings encryption** (32-character key) and secure environment variables (e.g., Docker secrets) to protect credentials [7].

### **Access Control and Authentication**
Access to data is managed through **collection API rules**, allowing granular permissions for read/write operations [1][5]. Users can restrict access to specific records per user, improving compliance with **data minimization** and **purpose limitation** principles [4]. However, **column-level access control** is not natively supported, requiring workarounds like separate collections or custom views [6].

### **Regulatory Alignment**
To meet **GDPR** and **CCPA** requirements, users must:
- Implement **consent management** (e.g., via third-party CMPs) for data collection [15][18].
- Enable **HTTPS** (via reverse proxy) to secure data in transit [8].
- Configure **audit logs** (manually or via hooks) to track data access and modifications [10].
- Use **role-based permissions** to enforce least-privilege access [1][4].

For **high-risk environments**, PocketBase recommends placing the backend behind a reverse proxy to add **rate limiting, IP whitelisting, and DDoS protection** [8][11].

### **Limitations**
PocketBase lacks built-in features for **automated data subject requests (DSARs)**, **right-to-erasure workflows**, or **privacy impact assessments (DPIAs)**. Users must implement these via custom scripts or integrations [10][12].

## Comparison with GitHub Compliance Standards

### **Security**
PocketBase follows security best practices but relies heavily on user-defined API rules for data protection. It handles input sanitization via built-in collection APIs and supports OAuth 2.0 for authentication, though it replaces provider tokens with its own auth tokens [1][2]. GitHub, in contrast, enforces stricter security measures, including **OWASP Top 10 compliance**, automated secret scanning, and **SOC 2/ISO 27001 certification** [3][4]. PocketBase lacks built-in rate limiting by default, requiring manual configuration [2], whereas GitHub provides **DDoS protection** and **automated vulnerability scanning**.

### **Licensing**
PocketBase is **MIT-licensed**, allowing unrestricted use and modification [5]. GitHub also supports open-source projects but enforces stricter **Data Processing Agreements (DPAs)** and **Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)** for GDPR compliance [6]. While PocketBase’s permissive license encourages adoption, GitHub’s legal frameworks ensure enterprise-grade compliance.

### **Data Protection**
PocketBase offers **basic file security** (randomized filenames) but lacks advanced encryption or GDPR-specific features [7]. GitHub, however, provides **end-to-end encryption**, **Data Privacy Framework (DPF) compliance**, and **automated GDPR/CCPA compliance tools** [6][8]. PocketBase’s self-hosted nature grants data control but shifts compliance burdens to users, unlike GitHub’s managed infrastructure.

### **Key Differences**
- **GitHub excels** in automated compliance (GDPR, CCPA, SOC 2) and enterprise security.
- **PocketBase offers simplicity** but requires manual security hardening (e.g., rate limiting, encryption).
